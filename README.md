# Intro to jQuery 

1. *What is jQuery?*
jQuery is a JavaScript library that makes it easier to work with the DOM (Document Object Model) in web development. It provides a simple, consistent API for manipulating the elements and content of a web page, as well as handling events, making AJAX requests, and creating animations. jQuery also provides a number of built-in functions and methods that can be used to perform common tasks such as selecting elements, changing their content or styles, and adding or removing classes. One of the main advantages of jQuery is that it abstracts away many of the browser inconsistencies and complexities of working with the DOM, so you can write cross-browser compatible code more easily. It also provides a shorthand syntax that makes it more concise and readable than pure JavaScript, which can help make your code more maintainable. jQuery is widely used in web development, and many popular JavaScript frameworks and libraries, such as AngularJS, React, and Vue.js, are built on top of it.

2. *What does it mean to have access to the DOM?*
In JavaScript and jQuery, having access to the DOM means that you can use the DOM API to manipulate the elements and content of a web page, such as adding or removing elements, changing the text or attributes of elements, and responding to events such as clicks or user input. This allows you to create dynamic and interactive web pages that can respond to user actions and update in real-time.

3. *Which is better to do - source jQuery with the CDN link or with download the file to your desktop?*
Depend, however in general, if your website has a high traffic, using a CDN link for jQuery is recommended for better performance and faster load times. However, if you need more control over the version of the library or if you need to make customizations, it's better to download the library to your computer.

4. *What are Selectors in jQuery:*
jQuery selectors allow you to select and manipulate HTML element(s). jQuery selectors are used to "find" (or select) HTML elements based on their name, id, classes, types, attributes, values of attributes and much more.
